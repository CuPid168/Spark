# SPARK: Dummy Model Training

This repository contains code for dummy training of the SPARK model using a synthetic dataset.

## About SPARK Model

SPARK (Student Performance Assessment and Reporting Kit - *feel free to change the expanded name or remove it if SPARK is just the name*) is a time series model designed to provide an objective assessment of student skills and competencies. It utilizes student data, such as scores in subjects like mathematics, biology, and others, to generate these assessments.

This implementation focuses on demonstrating the model's training process with synthetic data for development and testing purposes.
